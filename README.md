The Layers Demo is a minimal Layers application that demonstrates the capabilities of the Layers software library. The source-code demonstrates how to get a basic Layers application up and running, while the binary release is provided to let developers see a Layers app in action.

## Development and Testing

These are the steps to install a copy of Layers Demo source-code on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

It is recommended to clone a copy of the project repository to be able to use project features that have been implemented. You may clone the project's repository with:
