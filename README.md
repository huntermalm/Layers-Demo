The Layers Demo is a minimal Layers application that demonstrates the capabilities of the Layers software library.

## Development and Testing

These are the steps to install a copy of Layers Demo source-code on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

It is recommended to clone a copy of the project repository to be able to use project features that have been implemented.  You may clone the project's repository with:

> git clone https://github.com/huntermalm/Layers-Demo.git

You may also download a .zip of the project [here](https://github.com/huntermalm/Layers-Demo/archive/main.zip).

##### The following dependencies must be installed before attempting to run the Layers Demo from source-code:
* Layers
* Qt 5.13.2 (Future Qt versions may work but have not been tested.)

## Installation

**Since Layers development is still in the alpha stage, do not expect everything this library has to offer to be stable or functional. Alpha releases are provided for developers to test library functionality. It is not recommended to start developing your application with a Layers alpha build since things can change before a production build is released.**

Grab the latest version of Layers from the downloads below.  Follow the standard library linking process for your IDE.
